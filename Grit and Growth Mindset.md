# Grit and Growth Mindset

**Grit** and **Growth Mindset** are two powerful psychological concepts that influence success, resilience, and personal development. Though related, they focus on different aspects of how we deal with challenges and growth.

## 1. Growth Mindset

**Definition**:  
A **growth mindset** is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, effort, and learning.

**Coined by**: Dr. Carol Dweck, Stanford University psychologist.

### Characteristics:
- Embraces challenges.
- Learns from criticism.
- Believes effort leads to mastery.
- Persists despite setbacks.
- Inspired by others' success.

### Opposite: Fixed Mindset
- Believes abilities are innate and unchangeable.
- Avoids challenges.
- Gives up easily.
- Sees effort as fruitless.

### Example:
If someone fails a math test:  
- **Growth mindset**: "I didn’t do well, but I can study more and improve."  
- **Fixed mindset**: "I’m just bad at math, and nothing can change that."

## 2. Grit

**Definition**:  
**Grit** is the passion and perseverance for long-term and meaningful goals, even in the face of difficulty or failure.

**Popularized by**: Dr. Angela Duckworth in *"Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance"*.

### Characteristics:
- Long-term stamina and endurance.
- Maintains effort and interest over time.
- Resilient in tough times.
- Driven by purpose and passion.

### Grit ≠ Talent:
Grit is about persistence and consistency, not natural ability.

### Example:
Someone who trains for years to become a doctor despite repeated failures is showing grit.
