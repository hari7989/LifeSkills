### 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would:

- **Speak up** if I feel safe, letting the person know their behaviour is inappropriate and unwelcome.
- **Document the incident**: Note the date, time, location, people involved, and what exactly happened.
- **Report the incident** to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) or HR team as soon as possible.
- **Support the victim** (if Iâ€™m a witness), by encouraging them to speak up or helping them report it.
- **Maintain confidentiality** and avoid discussing the incident unnecessarily.
- **Cooperate with any inquiry** conducted by the ICC.

Creating a respectful and safe workplace is a shared responsibility.
