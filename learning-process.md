# Learning Process – Q&A

---

## **Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique and how does it help in learning?**

The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you try to explain a concept in simple terms as if teaching it to someone else, helping you identify gaps in your understanding.

## **Question 2: What did you learn from the videos on learning techniques?**

One of the most interesting ideas from Barbara Oakley’s TED talk was how she transformed from someone who struggled with math to becoming a professor in engineering, proving that anyone can learn anything with the right techniques and persistence.

## **Question 3: What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**

- **Active Mode**: Focused, intense thinking used when you're consciously trying to solve a problem.  
- **Diffused Mode**: Relaxed, unconscious thinking that allows your brain to connect ideas and process information in the background.

## **Question 4: How should you approach learning software concepts, and how are you evaluated as a trainee?**

### **How to Learn Software Concepts:**

- **Where is this concept used or applied?**  
  Understanding where a concept is used helps relate it to real-world scenarios, making it more relevant and memorable.

- **What is the concept? Can I explain it to someone in my own words?**  
  Being able to explain a concept in your own words confirms true understanding.

- **How can I implement it in code or design?**  
  Implementing concepts in actual code or design bridges theory and practice, reinforcing learning.

- **By when do I need to complete the practice drills or assignment or project for this topic?**  
  Setting deadlines helps manage your learning time effectively and ensures consistent progress.

### **How Are You Evaluated as a Trainee?**

- **Does this person understand concepts well? Can they explain verbally and/or in writing?**  
  Clear verbal or written explanation of concepts shows true grasp of the material.

- **Does this person implement the concepts in code clearly?**  
  Code clarity reflects understanding and attention to detail.

- **Does this person work intensely and complete work in the allotted time?**  
  Time management and focus are essential for consistent progress and reliability.

- **Does this person communicate proactively about obstacles and difficulties?**  
  Open communication ensures problems are addressed quickly, improving learning speed.

- **Does this person communicate clearly in precise words?**  
  Clear and precise communication avoids confusion and strengthens team collaboration.

## **Question 5: What actions will you take to improve your learning process?**

- I will apply the Feynman Technique to explain concepts in simple terms.
- I’ll minimize distractions by silencing my phone and blocking social media during work hours.
- I will use time-tracking tools like Boosted to monitor productivity.
- I’ll schedule focused deep work sessions for intense learning.
- I’ll approach topics with curiosity and enthusiasm to make learning enjoyable.
- I will practice coding regularly to reinforce each concept.
- I’ll make sure I meet my personal deadlines and reach out for help when I’m stuck.
