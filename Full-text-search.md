# 1. Lucene

Lucene is a Java-based search library developed by Apache.  
It provides core indexing and search capabilities, but it is not a full-fledged search engine.

## Pros:
- High performance and flexibility (you have full control).
- Lightweight – you can embed it in Java applications directly.
- No network latency – embedded in your codebase.

## Cons:
- No built-in clustering, replication, or failover.
- No REST API – you need to write custom logic to expose Lucene as a service.
- Not scalable out-of-the-box – designed for local, single-node use.

## Best For:
- Java-only applications where full control is needed.
- Lightweight use-cases or tight integration with existing Java apps.

# 2. Solr

Solr is an enterprise search platform built on top of Lucene.  
Developed by Apache, provides RESTful APIs, GUI, and admin tools.

## Pros:
- Built-in advanced full-text search, filtering, faceting.
- Scalability using SolrCloud – supports sharding and replication.
- Good for complex querying and structured data.
- Rich ecosystem: Admin UI, logging, plugins.

## Cons:
- Slightly steeper learning curve compared to Elasticsearch.
- XML-based configuration can be cumbersome.
- Slower indexing than Elasticsearch in some benchmarks.

## Best For:
- Enterprises with complex structured + unstructured data.
- Need for robust analytics, rich search, and detailed control.
- Teams that already use other Apache tools.

# 3. Elasticsearch

A distributed full-text search engine built on top of Lucene.  
RESTful and JSON-based.  
Highly scalable and designed for cloud-native use.

## Pros:
- Easy to set up and use – excellent developer experience.
- Distributed by design – great for performance and horizontal scaling.
- Powerful real-time analytics and aggregations.
- Well-documented, massive community, widely adopted.

## Cons:
- Memory-heavy – needs careful JVM tuning.
- Writes can be more expensive due to indexing overhead.
- Security and advanced features (e.g., RBAC, alerting) are often part of paid tiers in Elastic Stack.

## Best For:
- Applications needing real-time, scalable search and analytics.
- Logging (e.g., ELK Stack), e-commerce, app search, and large-scale systems.
- Quick development and deployment with REST API and JSON support.
