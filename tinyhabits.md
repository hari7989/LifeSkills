Tiny Habits - Reflection

1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg

Question 1

What was the most interesting story or idea for you in the video?

The best idea I liked was how doing small things can lead to big changes. BJ Fogg shared that he started by doing just two pushups after using the bathroom. Slowly, that turned into a full workout habit. This made me feel like I can also start small and improve over time without feeling overwhelmed. It reminded me that consistency matters more than intensity in the beginning.

2. Tiny Habits - Core Message

Question 2

How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What do M, A, and P stand for?

B = MAP means that behavior (B) happens when these three things come together:

M = Motivation – the desire to do the habit.

A = Ability – how easy or difficult the habit is.

P = Prompt – the reminder or trigger to start the habit.

If any one of these is missing, the habit may not happen. To make habits easier, we can lower the difficulty (increase ability), set reminders (prompt), and make sure we stay motivated by focusing on why the habit matters.

Question 3

Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Because when we celebrate right after doing a habit, it makes the brain associate the habit with a positive feeling. This builds confidence and joy. Even small celebrations like smiling, saying “I did it!”, or doing a fist pump can help the habit stick faster. Over time, this feeling of success will make us want to repeat the habit naturally.

3. 1% Better Every Day

Question 4

What was the most interesting story or idea for you in the video?

I liked the idea that getting just 1% better every day can lead to amazing results in the long term. It taught me that I don’t need to change everything overnight. Small, consistent improvements build up into big achievements. Even if progress feels slow at first, staying patient will give surprising results after months or years.

4. Atomic Habits - Book Summary

Question 5

What is the book's perspective about identity?

The book says that instead of focusing only on goals, we should focus on the person we want to become. For example, instead of saying “I want to read books,” we should say “I am a reader.” When this identity becomes part of us, we naturally do the habit without forcing ourselves. Identity-based habits are stronger because they shape who we believe we are.

Question 6

How does the book suggest making a habit easier to do?

It suggests removing friction. This means making the habit simple, obvious, and convenient. For example, if I want to drink more water, I can fill a water bottle and place it on my desk or bed where I can see it. The easier and clearer the habit is, the more likely I will do it without excuses.

Question 7

How does the book suggest making a habit harder to do?

To reduce a bad habit, the book suggests making it inconvenient. For example, if I spend too much time on social media, I can delete the apps or log out every time. I can even switch my phone off and put it in another room. When the habit becomes harder to start, the urge to do it slowly reduces, and I can replace it with a better habit.

5. Reflection

Question 8

Pick one habit that you would like to do more of.
What steps can you take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive or easy, and the response satisfying?

I want to build the habit of writing a journal every day to reflect on my thoughts and feelings.

Steps I will take:

I will keep my notebook and pen near my pillow, so I see it before sleeping.

I will start by writing just 2 simple lines to make it feel easy and quick.

I will make this a part of my night routine after brushing my teeth.

After finishing, I will smile, take a deep breath, and feel proud of myself to make the habit enjoyable.

On weekends, I can read my past entries to see how I’ve improved. This will motivate me to continue.

Question 9

Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of.
What steps can you take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, and the response unsatisfying?

I want to stop the habit of checking my phone as soon as I wake up because it wastes time and affects my mood.

Steps I will take:

I will keep my phone far away from my bed or even in another room while sleeping.

I will use an alarm clock instead of my phone to avoid needing the phone first thing.

I will remind myself how checking the phone early makes me lazy and distracted.

I will set a rule of “no phone” for at least the first 30 minutes after waking up.

I will make a new morning habit instead — like stretching or drinking water — so my mind feels refreshed.

If I break this rule, I will note it in my journal as a reminder, which will make me feel disappointed and push me to follow the rule the next day.

Additional Notes

Start small, stay consistent — this is the foundation of building any new habit.

Environment design matters: place helpful things nearby, and remove distractions from sight.

Reward yourself with small celebrations to make habits joyful.
